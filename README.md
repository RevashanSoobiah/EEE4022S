Magnetic Flux Analysis for Fault Detection in Induction Machines


Induction motors are severely prone to faults, leading to significant downtime for maintenance, thereby
increasing cost and lowering profit. Therefore, condition-monitoring techniques of induction motors have
captured the attention of researchers and manufacturers worldwide. Namely, non-invasive techniques
due to the preventative measures of not needing a costly downtime. This paper will analyse the use of
techniques such as Magnetic flux and Motor Current Signature Analysis to determine the effectiveness
of these techniques on Inter-turn faults within an induction motor. Additionally, recent advancements
in sensors and techniques have spotlighted Magnetic Flux analysis due to its non-intrusive nature and
simplistic setup. The limitations of each technique will be fleshed out after a series of tests. It will
be shown that neither technique proposed in this paper can effectively perform across varying fault
severity and load. As such, this paper recommends using Magnetic Flux and MCSA in conjunction
with machine learning models for future work.
